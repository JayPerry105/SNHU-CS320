    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    How do I approach designing software?


Throughout this course I learned many different software testing techniques and scenarios. The best way I know of to ensure my code is functional and secure would be to acheive as high of test coverage as I can. If I can get my test coverage to somewhere between 85%-100%, it will more than likely be safe to assume that virtually every aspect of the program has been tested. Ideally user needs would be interpretted in a literal fashion without any doubt in regard to what they wants. However, that is not usually the case. Many times a member of the development team will need to meet with customers and stakeholders to determine exactly what they are looking for in the product. I approach all software design/development problems with the SDLC in the back of my mind. If I am able to follow all the right steps and have the correct mindset when developing programs, that should give me a great jump in the right direction to be a successful developer.
